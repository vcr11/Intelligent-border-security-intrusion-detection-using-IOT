# Intelligent border security intrusion detection using IOT

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Border areas are generally considered as places where great deal of violence, intrusion and cohesion between several parties happens This often led to danger for the life of employees, soldiers and common man working or living in border areas.Further geographical conditions like mountains, snow, forest, deserts, harsh weather and water bodies often lead to difficult access and monitoring of border areas.To overcome this,we decided to build robot having futures like live monitoring,object,fire and metal detection using respective snsors.
