## Intelligent border security intrusion detection using IOT
## A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
1) Border areas are generally considered as places where great deal of violence. This often led to danger for the life of employees, 
soldiers and common man working or living in border areas. To overcome this, we decided to build a robot having futureslike live
monitoring, object, fire and metal detection using respective sensors.
2) Its easily tracks the missiles.
3) It saves manâ€™s power and works continuously 24/7
3) Less human power required for maintanance of robot

## Material Required:
1) Esp-32 cam
2) L293D motor Driver module
3) Gsm
4) Gps
5) Apr9600+speaker
6) Ultrasonic sensor
7) Metal sensor
8) Buzzer
9) Arduino
10) 12v battery-2
11) Arduino base board
12) Fire/gas sensor
13) Relay
14) Sprinkler

## Project Setup Process :
 # Step 1:
      Connect The Above Components perfectly on the PCB or any another Circuit board 
 # Step 2:
      Dump C++ Code into Arduino    
  # step 3
      Download Arduino Blutooth Controller on Your Mobile To handle Robot operation.
      We can also operate robot by Using Web browser and wifi for this we use another application and modules called # Network Scanner,ESP-32(Live Streaming)
  # Step 4
      Connect Your Mobile to Robot by Using blutooth or Ip.
